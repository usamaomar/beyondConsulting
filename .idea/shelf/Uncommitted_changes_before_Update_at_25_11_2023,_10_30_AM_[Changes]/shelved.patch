+   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+

+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
+      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+

+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

+   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+   meet the following conditions:
+
+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+

+
+Introduction
+============
+
+  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
+  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
+  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
+  FreeType Project.
+
+  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
+  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
+  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
+  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
+
+  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
+  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
+  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
+  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
+
+    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
+      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
+
+    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
+      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
+
+    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
+      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
+      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
+      FreeType code. (`credits')
+
+  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
+  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
+  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
+  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
+
+
+  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
+  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
+  encourage you to use the following text:
+
+   """
+    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
+    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
+   """
+
+  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
+  actually use.
+
+
+Legal Terms
+===========
+
+0. Definitions
+--------------
+
+  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
+  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
+  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
+  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
+  beta or final release.
+
+  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
+  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
+  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
+  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
+  engine'.
+
+  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
+  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
+  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
+  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
+  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
+  this license, you must contact us to verify this.
+
+  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
+  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
+  specified below.
+
+1. No Warranty
+--------------
+
+  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
+  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
+  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
+  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
+  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
+  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
+
+2. Redistribution
+-----------------
+
+  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
+  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
+  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
+  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
+  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
+  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
+  herein, subject to the following conditions:
+
+    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
+      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
+      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
+      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
+      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
+      files.
+
+    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
+      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
+      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
+      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
+      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
+
+  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
+  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
+  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
+  to us.
+
+3. Advertising
+--------------
+
+  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
+  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
+  purposes without specific prior written permission.
+
+  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
+  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
+  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
+  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
+
+  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
+  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
+  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
+  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
+  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
+  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
+  of this license.
+
+4. Contacts
+-----------
+
+  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
+
+    o freetype@nongnu.org
+
+      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
+      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
+      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
+      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
+
+    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org
+
+      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
+      specific licenses, porting, etc.

+Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
+under terms compatible with the above MIT license:
+
+Much of the math library code (third_party/math/* and
+third_party/complex/*, and third_party/include/libm.h) is
+Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
+Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
+Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
+Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
+Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier
+and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
+have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.
+
+The smoothsort implementation (third_party/smoothsort/qsort.c) is
+Copyright © 2011 Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style
+license.
+
+The x86_64 files in third_party/arch were written by Nicholas J. Kain
+and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
+
+All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
+produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
+by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
+contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
+can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
+omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
+interest of source tree size.
+
+In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
+(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
+applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
+the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
+license, and to use these files without any requirement of
+attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:
+
+Bobby Bingham
+John Spencer
+Nicholas J. Kain
+Rich Felker
+Richard Pennington
+Stefan Kristiansson
+Szabolcs Nagy
+
+all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.
+
+This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
+the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
+to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
+negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
+permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
+obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.

+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

+
+A large portion of the dictionary entries
+originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
+Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
+
+Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
+original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
+that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
+on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
+in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
+distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
+contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
+jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
+
+NO WARRANTY
+
+The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
+research and development conducted during the project and is provided
+to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
+program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
+implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
+includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
+performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
+the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
+any right of any third party.
+
+Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
+have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
+the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
+otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
+
+Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
+organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
+development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
+officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
+damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
+and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
+with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
+or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
+regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
+knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
+project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
+foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
+"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
+modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
+production of secondary products from the program.
+
+In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
+modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
+any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
+grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
+writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
+from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
+above as far as the program is concerned.

+  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

+  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+  as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+  meet the following conditions:
+
+  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+      stating that You changed the files; and
+
+  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+      the Derivative Works; and
+
+  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+      as modifying the License.
+
+  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+  the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+
+
+OVERVIEW
+========
+
+This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
+and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
+method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG's strong suit is compressing
+photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and
+brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or
+other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG
+quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such
+images.
+
+JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to
+the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other "smooth" images,
+very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression
+artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are
+willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the "quality" setting in the
+compressor.)
+
+This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
+compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
+processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
+We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless
+processes defined in the standard.
+
+We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
+plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
+perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
+The library is intended to be reused in other applications.
+
+In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
+considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
+for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
+decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
+colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
+library if not required for a particular application.
+
+We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between
+different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple
+applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.
+
+The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
+flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
+the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
+REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
+be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
+achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.
+
+We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
+No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
+documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.

+
+LEGAL ISSUES
+============
+
+In plain English:
+
+1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
+   please let us know!)
+2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
+3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
+   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
+   you've used the IJG code.
+
+In legalese:
+
+The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
+with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
+fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
+its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
+
+This software is copyright (C) 1991-2016, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
+All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
+
+Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
+software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
+conditions:
+(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
+README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
+unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
+must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
+(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
+documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
+the Independent JPEG Group".
+(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
+full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
+NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
+
+These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
+not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
+acknowledge us.
+
+Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
+in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
+it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
+software".
+
+We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
+commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
+assumed by the product vendor.
+
+
+The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
+It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
+The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
+ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
+but is also freely distributable.
+
+The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
+To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
+support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
+to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
+algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
+by all standard GIF decoders.
+
+We are required to state that
+    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
+    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
+    CompuServe Incorporated."
+
+
+REFERENCES
+==========
+
+We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
+understand the innards of the JPEG software.
+
+The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
+    Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
+    Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
+(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
+applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
+handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
+available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually
+a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
+omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
+and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
+and it may not be used for commercial purposes.
+
+A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
+"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
+M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
+good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
+including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
+code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
+sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
+at a full implementation, you've got one here...
+
+The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still
+Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.
+Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.
+Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG
+standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).
+
+The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual
+specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is
+titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
+Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
+10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
+Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
+numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.
+
+The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
+format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
+1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report
+and thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free
+download in PDF format from
+http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm.
+A PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at
+http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at
+http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.
+
+The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
+ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
+found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
+IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
+Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
+(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from
+http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision
+of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
+Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
+uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.

+
+FILE FORMAT WARS
+================
+
+The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (also known as JPEG, together
+with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name
+"JPEG" which are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG.  IJG therefore does
+not support these formats (see REFERENCES).  Indeed, one of the original
+reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on
+common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.
+Don't use an incompatible file format!
+(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG
+image files indefinitely.)

+   source, and configuration files.
+
+   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

+   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+   and conversions to other media types.
+
+   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

+   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

+   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+   meet the following conditions:
+
+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+
+Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
+non-exclusive license:
+
+(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
+    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
+    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
+    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
+    as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
+    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
+    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
+
+2.2. Effective Date
+
+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
+become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
+distributes such Contribution.
+
+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
+
+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
+this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
+distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
+Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
+Contributor:
+
+(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
+    or
+
+(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
+    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
+    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
+    Version); or
+
+(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
+    its Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
+or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
+the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
+distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
+License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
+permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
+Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
+to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
+applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
+equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
+in Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+-------------------
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
+the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
+Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
+License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
+attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
+Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
+    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
+    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
+    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
+    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
+    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
+    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
+    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
+provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
+the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
+Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
+Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
+License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
+under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
+the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
+Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
+License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
+(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
+or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
+the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
+the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
+Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
+such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
+liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
+disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
+jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
+statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
+be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
+Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
+or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
+recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+--------------
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
+if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
+compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
+Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
+ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
+non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
+come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
+first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
+from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
+Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
+counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
+directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
+You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
+2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
+end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
+have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
+prior to termination shall survive termination.

+*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
+*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
+*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *

+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be

+sqlite
+
+The source code for SQLite is in the public domain. No claim of
+copyright is made on any part of the core source code. (The
+documentation and test code is a different matter - some sections of
+documentation and test logic are governed by open-source licenses.)
+All contributors to the SQLite core software have signed affidavits
+specifically disavowing any copyright interest in the code. This means
+that anybody is able to legally do anything they want with the SQLite
+source code.
+
+There are other SQL database engines with liberal licenses that allow
+the code to be broadly and freely used. But those other engines are
+still governed by copyright law. SQLite is different in that copyright
+law simply does not apply.
+
+The source code files for other SQL database engines typically begin
+with a comment describing your legal rights to view and copy that
+file. The SQLite source code contains no license since it is not
+governed by copyright. Instead of a license, the SQLite source code
+offers a blessing:
+
+May you do good and not evil
+May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others
+May you share freely, never taking more than you give.
